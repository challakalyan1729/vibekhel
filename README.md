# 🏏 Vibekhel: From Street to Stadium
---

## 🚀 About the Project

**Vibekhel** is a sports-tech platform designed to identify, nurture, and elevate untapped cricket talent from the streets ("Gully Cricket") to professional stadiums. 

In a country where cricket is a religion, millions of talented players go unnoticed due to a lack of guidance and visibility. Vibekhel serves as a digital scout, providing a structured pathway for amateur players to track their stats, compete in local tournaments, and get discovered by professional scouts.

---

## 📉 The Problem
- **Lack of Visibility:** 85% of talented players remain in street cricket circles with no pathway to higher levels.
- **No Data Tracking:** Street matches go unrecorded; there is no verifiable data to prove a player's consistency or skill.
- **Unstructured Ecosystem:** Finding teams, tournaments, and genuine opportunities is chaotic and relies on word-of-mouth.

## 💡 The Solution
Vibekhel digitizes the grassroots cricket ecosystem. By moving from a traditional chaotic approach to a tech-driven platform, aim to significantly improve a player's career growth probability.

- **Digitized Profiles:** Every player gets a professional profile.
- **Performance Analytics:** Track runs, wickets, and strike rates just like international players.
- **The Ladder:** A clear path from *Local Matches* → *District Tournaments* → *National Level*.
